# NYC_Taxi_Trip_Time_Prediction

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the total ride duration for taxi trips in New York City. The primary dataset used for this task is the one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes essential information such as pick-up time, geographic coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

The challenge lies in leveraging the available data to create a reliable model capable of estimating the time it takes for a taxi trip to reach its destination. This prediction will assist both passengers and taxi service providers in improving their travel planning, enhancing efficiency, and reducing uncertainty.****
